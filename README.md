styling is incoming (going more 40k but may make another that is AOS and Old World based)
-
OR - instead of an app with a (grim)dark theme (LOLZ) i could make a 40k/AOS/Old World/HH theme?
-
i like that - i'm goin to do that
-
could even do an army theme
-
now im having a panic attack thinking about all the damn space marine chapter colour schemes

i should probabaly just start out the font first
-
i'm not sure how worth it that would be but it would be pretty cool to have
